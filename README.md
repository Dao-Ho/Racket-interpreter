# Racket Interpreter in Go

> I love the Racket language. But my love for this language is overbearing. So much so that I must leave it to learn a new one. This is my attempt at learning Go through building an interpreter for my beloved language, Racket.

Currently WIP

_Built with 💔 (for Racket) and ❤️ (for Go - TBD)_
